  'At the start of this week, you ovulate. Your egg is fertilized 12 to 24 hours later if a sperm penetrates it. Over the next several days, the fertilized egg will start dividing into multiple cells as it travels down the fallopian tube, enters your uterus, and starts to burrow into the uterine lining.',
  'Now nestled in the nutrient-rich lining of your uterus is a microscopic ball of hundreds of rapidly multiplying cells that will develop into your baby. This ball of cells, called a blastocyst, has begun to produce the pregnancy hormone hCG, which tells your ovaries to stop releasing eggs.',
  'Your ball of cells is now officially an embryo. Youre now about 4 weeks from the beginning of your last period. Its around this time – when your next period would normally be due – that you might be able to get a positive result on a home pregnancy test.',
